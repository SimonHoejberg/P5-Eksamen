\subsection{Network Structure}
\begin{frame}{Network Structure}

\begin{itemize}
\item why does it look like this?
\item which features are used and how are their domains defined?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\subsection{Constructing the Tables}
\begin{frame}{Constructing the Tables}

\begin{itemize}

\item which cpt are needed?
\item how was it done? 
\item flawed methodology?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\subsection{The Result}
\begin{frame}{The Result}

\begin{itemize}
\item Problems with changing vectors
\item how can we work around this? --> expanded movement options or complete change?

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\subsection{Implementation of the Belief Network}
\begin{frame}{Implementation of the Belief Network}

\begin{itemize}
\item hypothetical solutions
\item have a scaled down version on the nxt
\item set up a connection to a pc for processing power

   \item Bluetooth vs Serial connection
   \item Defeats the purpose of an embedded system?
\end{itemize}
