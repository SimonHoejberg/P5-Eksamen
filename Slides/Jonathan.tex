\subsection{Network Structure}
\begin{frame}{Network Structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item What does the network look like?
\item Which features are used and how are their domains defined?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Vector - The vector the target is travelling at
  \item SA - The angle at which the target is sensed
  \item SD - The distance to the target

Vector - The vector the target is travelling at
SA - The angle at which the target is sensed
SD - The distance to the target
(Add a picture to visuallize the domains of angle and distance)

\subsection{Constructing the Tables}
\begin{frame}{Constructing the Tables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Which conditional probability tables are needed?
\item How was it done? 
\item Was the methodology flawed?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{The Resulting Network}
\begin{frame}{The Resulting Network}
\begin{itemize}
\item Problems with changing vectors
\item How can we work around this?
\item \begin{itemize}
  \item Expanded movement options?
  \item Complete rework?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Implementation of the Belief Network}
\begin{frame}{Implementation of the Belief Network}
\begin{itemize}
\item Have a scaled down version of the network on the Nxt
\item Set up a connection to a pc for processing power
\item \begin{itemize}
   \item Bluetooth vs Serial connection
   \item Defeats the purpose of an embedded system?
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
