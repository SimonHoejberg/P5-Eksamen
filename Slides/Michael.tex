	\only<1->{\textit{
		How can an autonomous turret be constructed, designed and imple- mented using the NXT, a camera and a pair of ultrasonic distance sensors. Furthermore, how can a belief network be constructed and used for predicting the position of the target.}

	\only<2->{
		Many of the technical aspects were completed
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Rotating 360 degrees
			\item Capable of firing multiple shots
			\item Verticle angle capable of adjusting shooting length
			\item Capable of working with a target travelling in different directions
		\end{itemize}
	}
	\only<3->{
		But on the other hand
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Only 1 range and speed combination where we actually hit
			\item Currently operating on restricted parameters
		\end{itemize}
	}
	\only<4>{
		In conclusion:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Partially succesful, although not satisfactory
			\item Given enough time, could work satisfactory
			\item The groundwork for implementing more advanced features is already there
		\end{enumerate}
